Introduction to Processing
==========================

This course is inspired by two classes taught at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University: [Introduction to Computational Media](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2013/blob/master/Syllabus-2013-All.md) and [Printing Code](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/). The aim of the workshop is to introduce the concepts of programming through exercises inspired by the field of graphic design.

Overview
--------

### What is programming?

* What is programming?
* What is a programming language?
* Why would I use code for designing things?
* What is Processing?

### History of Computational Design

* [Lecture](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-intro/)

### Basic Drawing

* Screen coordinates
* `size()`
* Drawing and color functions
    * `rect()` and `rectMode()`
    * `ellipse()` and `ellipseMode()`
    * `fill()` and `stroke()` with greyscale and color
* Processing reference
* Exercise: Make a drawing of an alien

### Animation

* `setup()` and `draw()`
* `mouseX` and `mouseY`
* [Declaring, initializing and using variables](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing/tree/master/chp04_variables)
* [Mouse and key events](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing/blob/master/chp03_flow/example_3_5_mouse_key_events/example_3_5_mouse_key_events.pde)
