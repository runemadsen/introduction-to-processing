Introduction to Processing
==========================

This course is inspired by two classes taught at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University: [Introduction to Computational Media](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2013/blob/master/Syllabus-2013-All.md) and [Printing Code](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/). The aim of the workshop is to introduce the concepts of programming through exercises inspired by the field of graphic design.

Overview
--------

### About the Class

* Introductions
* Introduction to programming through graphic design
* Not necessarily data visualization
* Ask questions. Let me know if I'm too slow or too fast.
* Book: Learning Processing - Daniel Shiffman

### What is programming?

* What is programming?
* What is a programming language?
* Why would I use code for designing things?
* What is Processing?

### History of Computational Design

* [Lecture](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-intro/)

### Form and Composition

* Screen coordinates
* `size`, `width` and `height`
* Drawing and color functions
    * `rect()` and `rectMode()`
    * `ellipse()` and `ellipseMode()`
    * `fill()` and `stroke()` with greyscale and color
* Processing reference
* Exercise: Draw an ice cream cone using only an ellipse, rectangle and triangle
* Positioning and placement in Processing
* Exercise: Center your cone even if you change the size of the canvas

### Color

* RGB

### Animation

* `setup()` and `draw()`
* Variables
    - Declaring and types
    - Initializing
    - Using variables
    - Exercise: Change your cone to use variables instead of hardcoded numbers
    - Exercise: Make a ball move across the screen using an incrementing variable
* `mouseX` and `mouseY`
    - Exercise: Make the ball follow the mouse
* `mousePressed` and `keyPressed`
    - Exercise: Draw a ball on the screen whenever the mouse is clicked
* `random()`
* `map()`
* Exercise: Make a jittering/nervous shape that follows the mouse
* Exercise: Use `random()` to make a little painting system

### Interaction

* Conditionals
    - `if`, `else`, `if else`
    - Exercise: Make moving ball show repeat when going across the screen
    - Booleans
    - Operators
* Loops
    - `While`
    - `for` 
    - Exercise: Draw lines across the screen 
    - Exercise: Draw a pie chart
Exercise: ?????

### Functions

* What is a function?
* Calling vs. defining
* Parameters
* Exercise: ?????

### Repetition

* Arrays

### Advanced Drawing

* `beginShape()` and `endShape()`
* `vertex()`, `curveVertex()`
* Exercise: Draw a house
* Bezier Curves and `bezierVertex()`
* Exercise: Draw a curved shape

### Advanced Color

* [Additive and Subtractive color systems](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-color/)
* `colorMode` and `HSB`

### Typography

* Creating and using fonts in Processing

### Pixels

* [Transformation in Processing](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-transformation/)
* Images
    - Load and display images
    - The pixels array
* Exercise: make an interactive image processing filter

### Data

* Table
* XML
* JSON
* Using API's

### Etc

* Perlin Noise
* Toxiclibs
* sin/cos
