Introduction to Processing
==========================

This course is inspired by two classes taught at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University: [Introduction to Computational Media](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2013/blob/master/Syllabus-2013-All.md) and [Printing Code](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/). The aim of the workshop is to introduce the concepts of programming through exercises inspired by the field of graphic design.

Overview
--------

### What is programming?

* What is programming?
* What is a programming language?
* Why would I use code for designing things?
* What is Processing?

### History of Computational Design

* [Lecture](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-intro/)

### Basic Drawing

* Screen coordinates
* `width` and `height`
* Drawing and color functions
    * `rect()` and `rectMode()`
    * `ellipse()` and `ellipseMode()`
    * `fill()` and `stroke()` with greyscale and color
* Processing reference
* Exercise: Make a drawing of an alien
* Positioning and placement in Processing

### Animation

* `setup()`, `draw()` and `size()`
* `mouseX` and `mouseY`
* [Declaring, initializing and using variables](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing/tree/master/chp04_variables)
* [Mouse and key events](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing/blob/master/chp03_flow/example_3_5_mouse_key_events/example_3_5_mouse_key_events.pde)
* `random()`
* `map()`
* Exercise: Make a jittering/nervous shape that follows the mouse
* Exercise: Use `random()` to make a little painting system

### Interaction

* Conditionals
    - `if`, `else`, `if else`
    - Booleans
    - Operators
* Loops
    - `While`
    - `for` 
Exercise: ?????

### Functions

* What is a function?
* Calling vs. defining
* Parameters
* Exercise: ?????

### Repetition

* Arrays

### Advanced Drawing

* `beginShape()` and `endShape()`
* `vertex()`, `curveVertex()`
* Exercise: Draw a house
* Bezier Curves and `bezierVertex()`
* Exercise: Draw a curved shape

### Advanced Color

* [Additive and Subtractive color systems](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-color/)
* `colorMode` and `HSB`

### Typography

* Creating and using fonts in Processing

### Pixels

* Images
    - Load and display images
    - The pixels array
* Exercise: make an interactive image processing filter

### Data

* Table
* XML
* JSON
* Using API's

### Etc

* Perlin Noise
* Toxiclibs
* 

### TODO

* Exercises / Examples from Printing Code
